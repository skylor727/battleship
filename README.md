# **Welcome to the Game of Battleship**
- Start by placing your ships.
    - By default the ships will be set to horizontal. Check the box if you'd like to place your ship vertically.
- Once all ships are placed the game will begin and it will be your turn to pick a location to fire.
- Once you select a location the grid box will be colored based on if you landed a <span style="color:#d745ff">**HIT**</span> or <span style="color:#15392a">**MISS**</span>.
- If you have <span style="color:#09092c">**SUNK**</span> a ship the colors of the tiles that contained the ship will be changed.
- The game will end when either the player or the computer has no ships standing.
    - If you'd like to play again a button will appear for you to restart the game
